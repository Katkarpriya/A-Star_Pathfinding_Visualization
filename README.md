# A-Star_Pathfinding_Visualization
A* (pronounced "A-star") is a popular and efficient search algorithm used to find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It is widely used in various fields such as computer science, robotics, and artificial intelligence, especially for pathfinding and graph traversal. The algorithm combines the advantages of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (which guarantees the shortest path) and Greedy Best-First Search (which explores nodes with the lowest cost first), making it both optimal and complete.

A* uses a heuristic approach to guide the search towards the goal more efficiently. The key idea behind A* is to evaluate nodes by considering both the cost to reach the node and the estimated cost to reach the goal from that node.

1. Use Right click for start/goal
2. Left click for obstacles
3. Press Space_bar for Start searching
